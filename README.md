# 🔐 NotarAI – AI-Powered Decentralized Document Verification

**NotarAI** is a modern Web3 application that combines **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Blockchain** to analyze, validate, and notarize documents in a fully decentralized and tamper-proof way.

Built with **Vue 3 + Quasar**, it delivers a seamless, high-performance user experience while leveraging **smart contracts**, **IPFS**, and **AI services** to enable trustless document authentication.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 AI-Enhanced Document Processing

- OCR-based text extraction from PDF and image documents
- Language model-driven metadata extraction (dates, signatories, clause detection)
- Document summarization and classification using OpenAI/Claude

### 🔗 Blockchain-Backed Proofs

- Immutable file hashes stored on the Polygon Mumbai testnet
- Smart contract-verifiable proof-of-existence and authenticity
- Cryptographic signing and transaction recording via MetaMask

### 🗂️ Decentralized Storage with IPFS

- Optional upload of documents to **IPFS** via [web3.storage](https://web3.storage/)
- Public or encrypted document access (future roadmap)

### 🦊 Web3 Wallet Integration

- MetaMask + WalletConnect support via `vue-dapp`
- Signature-based authorization of all blockchain operations

### 🔒 Privacy-First

- Local AI processing available
- No sensitive data shared externally without user consent

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User uploads a document (PDF/image)
2. Text is extracted using **OCR**
3. Extracted text is analyzed by AI (OpenAI or local model)
4. Metadata is returned to frontend, document is hashed using SHA-256
5. User connects MetaMask and signs the document hash
6. Smart contract stores the hash immutably on-chain
7. Optionally, the document is uploaded to IPFS
8. Users can verify the document anytime via its hash and transaction record

---

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.10+
- MetaMask installed in your browser
- OpenAI API Key (or Hugging Face alternative)
- Mumbai testnet wallet (use [Polygon Faucet](https://mumbaifaucet.com/))

### 🚧 Setup Instructions

#### 1. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
quasar dev

#### 2. Backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

#### 3. Smart Contracts
cd contracts
npm install
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai

🔐 Remember to set up .env files for:
API keys (OpenAI, web3.storage)
RPC provider (e.g. Alchemy or Infura for Mumbai)
Contract addresses

🔮 Roadmap
AI-driven document summary
Smart contract for hash storage
Wallet connection (MetaMask/Web3)
IPFS document uploads
Document verification page
IPFS encryption support
DAO voting for notarization
zkProof verification (privacy layer)
Mobile and Desktop builds

📷 UI Preview (Coming Soon)
Upload view with real-time document preview
AI output card with summary + metadata
Wallet connect + transaction success UI
Proof explorer with hash + block details
```

🧪 Testing
To run smart contract tests:
bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat test

For frontend testing (optional):
cd frontend
npm run test
Backend API can be tested via Postman or Swagger docs (autogenerated by FastAPI).
